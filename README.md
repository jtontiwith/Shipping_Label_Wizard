## Notes

I think I kept with the spirit of the instructions, but didn't follow them to the letter. If it had been a work assignment, I would have asked
the architect some questions about the design of the component hierarchy. I made the decision to follow what I believed to be the intent of the design, and to code it up how I saw fit as opposed to coming back to you guys with questions. I figured that would give you insight into how I'd code something in the absense of a back-and-forth, which is probably pretty useful to know as well.

Some things were left out and or handled in ways other than those specified in the PDF. At times, I had trouble understanding language such as "when the step wants the wizard to take an action" and the like.

Additionally, I left the ShippingLabel component blank. The display of the data held in the wizardContext object is carried out by the ConfirmShipping component so I opted to not duplicate the logic in ShippingLabel. 

Thank you.
